Next steps:

1. Run the migrations:
   rails db:migrate

2. Edit the initializer to define your plans:
   config/initializers/pricing_plans.rb

3. Add the Limitable mixin to models that should be limited:
   
   class Product < ApplicationRecord
     belongs_to :organization
     include PricingPlans::Limitable
     limited_by_pricing_plans :products, billable: :organization
   end

4. Add controller guards to enforce limits:
   
   require_feature! :api_access, billable: current_organization
   
   result = require_plan_limit! :products, billable: current_organization
   redirect_to pricing_path if result.blocked?

5. Optional: Add view helpers for pricing tables and usage meters:
   
   rails generate pricing_plans:pricing
   
6. Optional: Set up mailers for limit notifications:
   
   rails generate pricing_plans:mailers
