### Some features

Enforcing pricing plans is one of those boring plumbing problems that look easy from a distance but get complex when you try to engineer them for production usage. The poor man's implementation of nested ifs shown in the example above only get you so far, you soon start finding edge cases to consider. Here's some of what we've covered in this gem:

- Safe under load: we use row locks and retries when setting grace/blocked/warning state, and we avoid firing the same event twice. See [grace_manager.rb](lib/pricing_plans/grace_manager.rb).

- Accurate counting: persistent limits count live current rows (using `COUNT(*)`, make sure to index your foreign keys to make it fast at scale); per‑period limits record usage for the current window only. You can filter what counts with `count_scope` (Symbol/Hash/Proc/Array), and plan settings override model defaults. See [limitable.rb](lib/pricing_plans/limitable.rb) and [limit_checker.rb](lib/pricing_plans/limit_checker.rb).

- Clear rules: default is to block when you hit the cap; grace periods are opt‑in. In status/UI, 0 of 0 isn’t shown as blocked. See [plan.rb](lib/pricing_plans/plan.rb), [grace_manager.rb](lib/pricing_plans/grace_manager.rb), and [view_helpers.rb](lib/pricing_plans/view_helpers.rb).

- Simple controllers: one‑liners to guard actions, predictable redirect order (per‑call → per‑controller → global → pricing_path), and an optional central handler. See [controller_guards.rb](lib/pricing_plans/controller_guards.rb).

- Billing‑aware periods: supports billing cycle (when Pay is present), calendar month/week/day, custom time windows, and durations. See [period_calculator.rb](lib/pricing_plans/period_calculator.rb).


### Downgrades and overages

When a customer moves to a lower plan (via Stripe/Pay or manual assignment), the new plan’s limits start applying immediately. Existing resources are never auto‑deleted by the gem; instead:

- **Persistent caps** (e.g., `:projects, to: 3`): We count live rows. If the account is now over the new cap, creations will be blocked (or put into grace/warn depending on `after_limit`). Users must remediate by deleting/archiving until under cap.
- 
- **Per‑period allowances** (e.g., `:custom_models, to: 3, per: :month`): The current window’s usage remains as is. Further creations in the same window respect the downgraded allowance and `after_limit` policy. At the next window, the allowance resets.

Use `OverageReporter` to present a clear remediation UX before or after applying a downgrade:

```ruby
report = PricingPlans::OverageReporter.report_with_message(org, :free)
if report.items.any?
  flash[:alert] = report.message
  # report.items -> [#<OverageItem limit_key:, kind: :persistent|:per_period, current_usage:, allowed:, overage:, grace_active:, grace_ends_at:>]
end
```

Example human message:
- "Over target plan on: projects: 12 > 3 (reduce by 9), custom_models: 5 > 0 (reduce by 5). Grace active — projects grace ends at 2025-01-06T12:00:00Z."

Notes:
- If you provide a `config.message_builder`, it’s used to customize copy for the `:overage_report` context.
- This reporter works regardless of whether any controller/model action has been hit; it reads live counts and current period usage.

#### Override checks

Some times you'll want to override plan limits / feature gating checks. A common use case is if you're responding to a webhook (like Stripe), you'll want to process the webhook correctly (bypassing the check) and maybe later handle the limit manually.

To do that, you can use `require_plan_limit!`. An example to proceed but mark downstream:

```ruby
def webhook_create
  result = require_plan_limit!(:projects, enforceable: current_organization, allow_system_override: true)

  # Your custom logic here.
  # You could proceed to create; inspect result.grace?/warning? and result.metadata[:system_override]
  Project.create!(metadata: { created_during_grace: result.grace? || result.warning?, system_override: result.metadata[:system_override] })

  head :ok
end
```

Note: model validations will still block creation even with `allow_system_override` -- it's just intended to bypass the block on controllers.
